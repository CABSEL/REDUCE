REDUCE is an algorithm for optimal design of gene knock-out (KO) for the purpose of gene regulatory network (GRN) inference. Please refer to our manuscript entitled "Optimal design of gene knock-out experiments for gene regulatory network inference" for more details regarding the algorithm. The archive zip file provides MATLAB scripts for REDUCE.

Prerequisites: MATLAB 2014b (also tested on Octave 3.2.4), Python 2.7
